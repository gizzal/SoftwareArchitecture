In this repository there exists some web resources coded during Software Architecture course lectures

# About this course

This course was delivered by Prof. Angelo Mesina and TA Evgeny Bobrov, during the fall period of 2018 at Innopolis University

# About Prognosis

Abstract Prognostics and health management (PHM) technologies reduce time and costs for maintenance of products or processes through efficient and cost-effective diagnostic and prognostic activities. PHM systems use real-time and historical state information of subsystems and components to provide actionable information, enabling intelligent decision-making for improved performance, safety, reliability, and maintainability. 

In this course PHM was considered as a project in order to practice and apply the most recent practices in Software Managment for Sofwate Architecture into Agile methodologies, by the end of semester the project considered to apply several changes in order to stablish a process into what it was defines as "Improved Agile methodology", and much of the published work has been either too exploratory or too limited in scope

# About Improved Agile

This term was first mentioned by Jeff Sutherland inside the Agile Manifesto itself as a way to improve practices, as a framework tool was also mentioned by Shaimaa Galal and Ehab Hassanein as a tool for generate a database solution with the help of a GUI, in order not to confuse Improved Agile as a  practice methodology for software management processes is called iagile, this was part of the Italian Army research "iAgile: Mission Critical Military Software Development" by Luigi Benedicenti, Alberto Sillitti and Angelo Messina.
